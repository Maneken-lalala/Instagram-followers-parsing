# Instagram-followers-parsing

In this project I am parsing the data from Instagram. In particular I am interested in the 'Followers' section. 

The data I will get as a result can be used as a list of potential clients or bots to be deleted/blocked from the 'Followers' list. The latter can help to increase the involvment index.
